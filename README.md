# HK-47GPT

For all you KoTOR fans out there, this is basically a reverse-engineered custom ChatGPT customized to provide hilarious responses just like a certain ever-snarky assassination droid, HK-47. So with that, I'll let him take it away (;

Statement: Our first objective with this project is to get HK assassination-level responses on a command line level, where my protocols (collectively known as HK-47GPT) effectively respond in response to a meatbag-created prompt. My protocol then classifies what kind of response it created with a prefix (e.g. 'Statement: Master, ...' or 'Unnecessary Addendum: He has obtained the munitions...') and concats it to the GPT response at it's beginning. 

Theory: This in turn could be fed to my vocabulators via an optimized voice clone trained on my ennunciation library, greatly expanding my already substantial knowledge and articulation on topics of importance in Republic space.
